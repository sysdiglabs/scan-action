# Sysdig Secure Inline Scan Action

> ðŸš§ **Warning**: To use the Legacy Scanning Engine Action, please use version v3.* and visit the [previous README](./README.v3.md).

This action performs analysis on a specific container image and posts the result to Sysdig Secure. For more information about Sysdig CLI Scanner, see [Sysdig Secure documentation](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/installation/sysdig-secure/install-vulnerability-cli-scanner/running-in-vm-mode/).

## Inputs

### `cli-scanner-url`

URL to `sysdig-cli-scanner` binary download. The action will detect the runner OS and architecture. The version of the CLI Scanner is set to `1.8.1` by default (to specify another version see `cli-scanner-version`).

For more info about the Sysdig CLI Scanner download visit [the official documentation](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/installation/sysdig-secure/install-vulnerability-cli-scanner/).

### `cli-scanner-version`

Custom sysdig-cli-scanner version to download. It is set to `1.8.1` by default.

> Please note that the Action has only been tested with `1.8.x` versions and it is not guaranteed that it will work as expected with other versions.

### `registry-user`

Registry username to authenticate to while pulling the image to scan.

### `registry-password`

Registry password to authenticate to while pulling the image to scan.

### `stop-on-failed-policy-eval`

Fail the job if the Policy Evaluation is Failed.

### `stop-on-processing-error`

Fail the job if the Scanner terminates execution with errors.

### `severity-at-least`

Filtering option to only report vulnerabilities with at least the specified severity. Can take [`critical`|`high`|`medium`|`low`|`negligible`|`any`]. Default value "any" for no filtering.

For example, if `severity-at-least` is set to `medium`, only Medium, High or Critical vulnerabilities will be reported.

### `group-by-package`

Enable grouping the vulnerabilities in the SARIF report by package.

Useful if you want to manage security per package or condense the number of findings.

### `standalone`

Enable standalone mode. Do not depend on Sysdig backend for 
execution, avoiding the need of specifying 
'sysdig-secure-token' and 'sysdig-secure-url'. 

Recommended when using runners with no access to the internet. May require to specify custom `cli-scanner-url` and `db-path`.

### `db-path`

Specify the directory for the vulnerabilities database to use while scanning.

Useful when running in standalone mode.

### `skip-upload`

Skip uploading scanning results to Sysdig Secure.

### `skip-summary`

Skip generating Summary.

### `use-policies`

Specify Sysdig Secure VM Policies to evaluate the image.

### `override-pullstring`

Custom PullString to give the image when scanning and 
uploading. 

Useful when building images in a pipeline with temporary names. The custom PullString will be used to identify the scanned image in Sysdig Secure.

### `image-tag`

Tag of the image to analyse.

### `sysdig-secure-token`

API token for Sysdig Scanning authentication. (Required if not in 
Standalone mode.)

### `sysdig-secure-url`

Sysdig Secure Endpoint URL. Defaults to `https://secure.sysdig.com`. Please, visit the [official documentation](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/administration/saas-regions-and-ip-ranges/) for more details on endpoints and regions.

### `sysdig-skip-tls`

Skip TLS verification when calling Sysdig Secure endpoints.

### `extra-parameters`

Additional parameters to be added to the CLI Scanner. Note that these may not be supported with the current Action.

## SARIF Report

The action generates a SARIF report that can be uploaded using the `codeql-action/upload-sarif` action.

You need to assign an ID to the Sysdig Scan Action step, like:

```yaml
    ...

    - name: Scan image
      id: scan
      uses: sysdiglabs/scan-action@v4
      with:
        ...
```

and then add another step for uploading the SARIF report, providing the path in the `sarif_file` parameter:

```yaml
    ...
      - name: Upload SARIF file
        if: success() || failure() 
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with:
          sarif_file: ${{ github.workspace }}/sarif.json
```

The `if: success() || failure()` option makes sure the SARIF report is uploaded even if the scan fails and interrupts the workflow. (Q: Why not `always()`? A: That would allow for canceled jobs as well.)

## Example usages

### Build and scan image locally using Docker, and upload SARIF report

```yaml

    ...

    - name: Build the Docker image
      run: docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag sysdiglabs/dummy-vuln-app:latest

    - name: Scan image
      id: scan
      uses: sysdiglabs/scan-action@v4
      with:
          image-tag: sysdiglabs/dummy-vuln-app:latest
          sysdig-secure-token: ${{ secrets.SYSDIG_SECURE_TOKEN }}

      - name: Upload SARIF file
        if: success() || failure() 
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with:
          sarif_file: ${{ github.workspace }}/sarif.json

```

### Pull and scan an image from a registry

```yaml
    ...

    - name: Scan image
      uses: sysdiglabs/scan-action@v4
      with:
        image-tag: "sysdiglabs/dummy-vuln-app:latest"
        sysdig-secure-token: ${{ secrets.SYSDIG_SECURE_TOKEN }}
```

### Fail pipeline when Policy Evaluation is failed or scanner fails to run


```yaml
    ...

    - name: Scan image
      uses: sysdiglabs/scan-action@v3
      with:
        image-tag: "sysdiglabs/dummy-vuln-app:latest"
        sysdig-secure-token: ${{ secrets.SYSDIG_SECURE_TOKEN }}
        stop-on-failed-policy-eval: true
        stop-on-processing-error: true
```
